## 📊 Dataset

- **Source:** [Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uom190346a/sleep-health-and-lifestyle-dataset)
- **Description:** Contains demographics, sleep duration, stress levels, physical activity, and lifestyle factors.
- **Why chosen:**
  - Sleep disturbances are among the **most common symptoms of menopause** (especially for women 40+).
  - This dataset provides direct insights into how **age, gender, and lifestyle affect sleep**.
  - Closely aligned with **Precisia’s mission** to empower women with knowledge of their health.

## 💡 Unique, Actionable Insight

Women aged **40–50 average only 6.2 hours of sleep**, below the healthy **7–8 hours** recommended.  
Improving sleep by just 1 hour may **reduce hot flashes, stress, and improve well-being** during menopause.

## 🎨 Design & Technical Decisions

### 1. **Design Philosophy**

I approached the UI with a focus on **clarity, calmness, and empathy**, reflecting Precisia’s values:

- **Color palette**: Lavender, indigo, and teal → associated with health and serenity.
- **Typography**: Bold headers for confidence, clean sans-serif for readability.
- **Micro-interactions**: Smooth hover and chart animations to create delight without distraction.

### 2. **Implementation Choices**

- **React + Vite** → lightweight, fast dev environment.
- **Tailwind CSS** → utility-first styling enabled quick iteration and consistent responsive design.
- **Recharts** → elegant chart library for data visualization with minimal overhead.
- **Glassmorphism & gradients** → modern patterns to give the prototype a premium, award-winning feel.
- **Mobile-first layout** → optimized for accessibility on smaller screens, since most women 40+ will use mobile devices.

### 3. **How It Meets Task Requirements**

✔ Displays dataset in a continuous, easy-to-understand chart.  
✔ Highlights one unique, actionable health insight.  
✔ Uses a clean, intuitive, mobile-friendly design.  
✔ Includes clear write-up, technical reasoning, and instructions.
